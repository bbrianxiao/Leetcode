# 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II

## Overview
The `minFallingPathSum` function in the `Solution` class calculates the minimum sum of a falling path through a square `n x n` grid of integers. A falling path can start at any element in the first row and chooses the next element from the row directly below but in a different column. The solution uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

## Implementation Details
- **Dynamic Programming Table**:
  - A 2D vector `dp` is used where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at position `(i, j)`.
  - Initialize `dp[0][i]` for all columns `i` with the values from the first row of `grid`, as the starting point of paths are directly the first row elements.

- **Filling the DP Table**:
  - Iterate through each row of the grid starting from the second row. For each element at `(i, j)`, determine the minimum path sum by considering all possible columns `k` from the previous row `i-1` that are not in the same column as `j`.
  - Update `dp[i][j]` to be the minimum of its current value or the sum of the value from the potential previous position `(i-1, k)` and the current grid value `grid[i][j]`.

- **Calculating the Minimum Path Sum**:
  - After populating the `dp` table, iterate over the last row of `dp` to find the smallest value, which represents the minimum falling path sum.

## Time and Space Complexities
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^3)`, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns) of the grid. Each cell computation involves iterating over up to `n` different columns from the previous row, leading to a cubic time complexity relative to the grid dimension.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n^2)` due to the storage required for the `dp` table that holds the minimum path sum up to each cell in the grid.

## Usage
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> grid = {{2,1,3}, {6,5,4}, {7,8,9}};
Solution solution;
int result = solution.minFallingPathSum(grid);
// result will be 13, representing the minimum sum of a falling path through the grid.
