# Simplify Unix-style File Path (Updated Version)

## Overview
The `simplifyPath` function in the `Solution` class processes a Unix-style file path and simplifies it. The simplification process involves handling special path components like `.` (current directory), `..` (parent directory), and reducing multiple consecutive slashes to a single slash.

## Implementation Details
- The function uses a `stringstream` to split the input path string based on the `/` delimiter.
- A stack is employed to store the valid components of the path.
- As the path is split into components, each part is evaluated:
  - Empty components and `"."` (current directory) are ignored.
  - `".."` (parent directory) results in popping the top element from the stack, if the stack is not empty.
  - Other components are pushed onto the stack.
- After processing all components, the function constructs the simplified path from the stack's content in reverse order.

## Time and Space Compslexities
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the input path string. The function iterates through each character of the path once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, for storing the components of the path in the stack.

## Usage
```cpp
Solution solution;
string path = "/a/./b/../../c/";
string simplifiedPath = solution.simplifyPath(path);
// simplifiedPath will be "/c", the simplified version of the provided path
