# 20. Valid Parentheses

## Overview
The `isValid` function in the `Solution` class determines if a given string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'` is valid. A string is considered valid if all types of brackets are correctly closed and nested.

## Implementation Details
- **Stack Usage**:
  - Utilize a stack data structure to help track opening brackets as they occur in the string.
  - For each character in the string:
    - If it is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, or `'['`), push it onto the stack.
    - If it is a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, or `']'`):
      - Check if the stack is empty, which would mean there's no corresponding opening bracket for the closing one, returning `false`.
      - Otherwise, pop the top element of the stack and check if it matches the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If not, return `false`.
- **Final Check**:
  - After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if all opened brackets were properly closed. If the stack is not empty, return `false`.

## Time and Space Complexities
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character in the string is processed exactly once, either pushed or popped from the stack.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` in the worst case, when all characters are opening brackets, requiring space proportional to the length of the string in the stack.

## Usage
```cpp
string s = "()[]{}";
Solution solution;
bool result = solution.isValid(s);
// result will be true, as the string is a valid sequence of parentheses.
