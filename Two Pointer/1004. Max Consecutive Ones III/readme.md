# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

## Overview
The `longestOnes` function in the `Solution` class calculates the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array `nums` after flipping at most `k` 0's to 1's. This problem is addressed using a sliding window technique which effectively manages the balance between zeros flipped and the length of the window.

## Implementation Details
- **Sliding Window Technique**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `i` (start) and `j` (end), both set at the start of the array.
  - Iterate over `nums` with the `j` pointer to expand the window.
  - Increment a counter `currMax` to track the current window length.
  - When a `0` is encountered, decrement the `kleft` counter (which starts with the value `k` indicating the number of flips allowed).
  - If `kleft` falls below zero (indicating that more than `k` zeros have been flipped), contract the window from the left:
    - Move the `i` pointer to the right, and if the element at `i` was a `0`, increase `kleft`.
    - Adjust the `currMax` to reflect the reduced window size.
  - Continuously update `retval` to keep track of the maximum window size observed during the iteration.
- **Calculation and Return**:
  - After completing the iteration over `nums`, `retval` holds the maximum size of the window where at most `k` zeros can be flipped to obtain the longest run of consecutive 1's.

## Time and Space Complexities
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is processed once as the window expands and contracts, maintaining a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as the solution only uses a few additional variables for its operations and does not require extra space proportional to the input size.

## Usage
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1};
int k = 2;
Solution solution;
int result = solution.longestOnes(nums, k);
// result will be 6, representing the maximum number of consecutive 1's achievable by flipping at most 2 zeros.
