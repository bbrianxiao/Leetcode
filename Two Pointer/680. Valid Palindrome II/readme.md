# 680. Valid Palindrome II

## Overview
The `validPalindrome` function checks whether a given string can be converted into a palindrome by removing at most one character. This is an extension of the standard palindrome problem, allowing for a single modification for palindrome validation.

## Implementation Details
- The main function `validPalindrome` initiates the check.
- It uses a helper function `helper` to verify if a substring is a palindrome.
- The `validPalindrome` function iterates over the string using two pointers, `start` and `end`, moving towards the center.
- If mismatched characters are found, the function checks two possibilities: either removing the character at `start` or removing the character at `end`, using the `helper` function.
- If either case returns `true`, the entire string can be considered a valid palindrome after one removal.
- The algorithm handles the normal palindrome check as part of its iteration.

## Time and Space Complexities
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string. In the worst case, the function iterates through the entire string and performs up to two palindrome checks.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as the solution uses constant extra space regardless of the input string size.

## Usage
```cpp
Solution solution;
string s = "abca";
bool result = solution.validPalindrome(s);
// result will be true if 's' can be converted into a palindrome by removing at most one character
